# Joint-Savings-Account

![alt=“”](Images/20-5-challenge-image.png)

## Description

For this project, I am creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addressses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
